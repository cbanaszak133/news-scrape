[News-Scrape](https://pure-sierra-45774.herokuapp.com/)

This project is a web-app that scrapes data from NPR and displays the headline, a short description of the article, and
links to the artcle as well. The user is able to save certain articles and also leave comments on articles. All articles and
comments are saved in a MongoDB database, which are maniupulated by various API back-end commands. Handlebars was used in 
order to dynamically change the front-end. In the future, I hope to implement a feature that will push articles in terms of
most present to older articles.
